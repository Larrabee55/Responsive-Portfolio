    <p class="about-p">
      My name is Cameron and I am 20 years old. I grew up in Utah and ahave lived here for my whole life. I
      graduated from Taylorsville high school in 2016 and have been attending Salt lake Community college since
      then! I am currently working full time as a leasing agent and a student in the University of Utah coding
      bootcamp. My goal after this bootcamp is get a good career in computer science. I will start by getting a
      job in web development and will continue to go to school so I can learn as much as I can about computer
      science and advance up to a computer engineer or software engineer.

    <p class="about-p">
      I enjoy many things such as playing video games, riding my motorcycle, and being outside in the sun. I play
      many gmaes such as League of Legends, Player Unknown Battle Grounds, and Super Smash Bros. I own a 2007
      Honda CBR 600CC and enjoy riding on nice sunny days. I really enjoy taking it up the canyons.
